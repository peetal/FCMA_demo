    "### Purpose of this notebook\n",
    "- Given an experimental deisgn that consists of two conditions (A and B), we can ask whether the functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions differs across conditions. Traditional FC analyses employ a seed based approach, which can be biased in terms of the regions or netwroks it discovers (seeds are arbitrarily chosen) and miss potentially important regions which are meaningfully involved, but not systematically connected with the seed region (e.g., Wang et al., 2015). In order to perform whole-brain FC analyses in a manner which considers all pairwise correlations in the brain, FCMA was developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using FCMA, we can answer: \n",
    "     1. Do functional connectivity patterns differ between condition A and B? \n",
    "     2. If so, which brain regions are driving the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This jupyter notebook uses simulated data to demo how the above two questions could be answered with FCMA.\n"

The experiment consists of a **block design** and two conditions (A and B). **Each condition has 10 blocks (or epochs) for a total of 20 epcohs** for each subject. The order of the epochs were randomized across the 8 subjects. Each **epoch lasts for 15 time points** followed by **5 time points of ISI**. The total exepriment lasts 400 time points in total. Here, time points are arbitrary and are menat to correspond to single TRs in an actual study. \n",

    "- Going back our two initial questions, we asked:\n",
    "    1. Do functional connectivity patterns differ across condition A and B \n",
    "    2. What are the brain regions among which the FC pattern characterize each task condition? \n",
    "- Answering Q1: \n",
    "    - Based on the plot above, we can argue the functional connectivity pattern within the top n selected voxels can be used to differentiate whether a subject is doing condition A or B with relatively high accuracy. Thus, the answer to question 1 is yes! The FC patterns do differ across condition A and B.\n",
    "- Answering Q2:\n",
    "    - Let's take the top 30 voxel results as an example. Remember that the top 30 voxels for each training sets may be different given that we have 8 training sets (one for each left out subject). Thus a given voxel may appear 0 - 8 times in these 8 top-30-feature masks. This can be converted into proportions (what proportion of folds does each voxel end up in the top 30 voxels), resulting a voxelwise map. (i.e., 'prop_top30.nii.gz')\n",
    "    - Let's look at out cherry picked brain again, which is consist of 400 voxels in total. "
