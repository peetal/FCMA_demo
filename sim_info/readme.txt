1. brain_mask.nii.gz, brain_template.nii.gz: generated by brainiak.fmrisim for simulation purpose

2. ROI_A_mpfc.nii.gz, ROI_B_precuneus.nii.gz: two ROI cubes of 6x6x6. In the simulated data, all 216 voxels in mpfc sensitive to "condition" A but not B and all 216 voxels in precuneus sensitive to "condition" B but not A. The reason for constraining cherry picked voxels in two regions is for visualization purpose. Choosing mfpc and precuneus is arbitrary. 

3. full_mask.nii.gz: full cherry picked brain of 432 voxels. 

4. sub_noise_dict.txt: used for generating true noise. 

5. simulate_FCMA_dat.py: code for generating simulated data.
